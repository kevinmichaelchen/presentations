# What is a Git branch?

- üññ Branches allow developers to **diverge** from the main branch by creating
  separate branches to isolate code changes
- üëâ A branch is essentially a reference or a **pointer** to the latest commit in
  a given context; it‚Äôs not a container for commits.
- ü™∂ The Git branching model is **lightweight** compared to other version control systems.
- ‚õìÔ∏è Branches allow for **independent** lines of code that branch off the master branch, allowing developers to work independently before merging their changes back to the code base.

# What is a Git branching strategy?

Branching strategies help to

- üß† Enhance productivity by ensuring proper **coordination among developers**
- ‚õìÔ∏è Enable **parallel development**
- üèóÔ∏è Help organize a series of **planned, structured releases**
- üõ£Ô∏è Map a clear **path** when making changes to software through to production
- üêõ Maintain a **bug-free** code where developers can quickly fix issues and get these changes back to production without disrupting the development workflow

# GitFlow

Created by Vincent Driessen:[^1]

<v-click>

There are 2 immortal branches:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- `master` branch is always production-ready.
- `develop` always has the latest delivered dev changes.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

There are 3 types of supporting branches:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- **feature** ‚Äî both branched off and merged back into `develop`; typically only exist on localhost, not in the remote.
- **hotfixes** ‚Äî branched off `master` and merged back into both `developer` and `master`
- **releases** ‚Äî branched off `develop` and merged back into both `developer` and `master`

</v-clicks>

<div v-click>

When `develop` basically resembles a new release, that's when the release branch
is created.

# Downsides of GitFlow

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

A note from Gitflow's creator:
<blockquote class="mt-4 leading-6 w-5/6">
Web apps are typically continuously delivered, not rolled back, and you don't 
have to support multiple versions of the software running in the wild...
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="mt-4 leading-6 w-5/6">
If your team is doing continuous delivery of software, I would suggest to adopt
a much simpler workflow (like GitHub flow) instead of trying to shoehorn git-flow
into your team...
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="mt-4 leading-6 w-5/6">
If, however, you are building software that is explicitly versioned, or if you
need to support multiple versions of your software in the wild, then git-flow
may still be as good of a fit to your team as it has been to people in the last
10 years.
</blockquote>

# If not GitFlow, then what?

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">

<v-click>

Constant, continuous feedback is ideal.
We can't afford to wait too long to check if my changes work with yours.

</v-click>

<v-click>

Branches, by definition, are designed to isolate and hide change.
Continuous integration, by definition, is designed to expose change.

</v-click>

<v-click>

GitHub Flow[^1] (aka plain old _feature branching_) is a good alternative.

</v-click>

<v-click>

Farley encourages developers to merge directly into trunk, but that seems to
subvert the Pull Request reviewing process. PRs are also useful for squashing
commits and keeping trunk history tidy.

# What about marketing releases?

<v-click>

Long-lived branches are eschewed.

Commits are flying into main branch.

A robust testing suite inspires confidence.

</v-click>

<v-click>

But what about work done towards a marketing release with a special launch date?

What if a new feature isn't supposed to be enabled until the New Year, for example?
